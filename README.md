This repository contains the simple Arduino sketches with the description

* SketchAr010EmptyEmpty.ino 
the simplest sketch that provides no operations.

* SketchAr020BlinkOnOff.ino 
The sketch makes a LED on the Arduino plate light up and light off periodically.

* SketchAr030BlinkOnOnOnOff.ino 
The LED on the Arduino plate is switched on for 3 sec.
And the voltage of 5V between the GND port and the Pin13 is set.
Thereafter the LED turns out for the short time. 
At this short time no voltage is set to Pin13.

* SketchAr031BlinkControlLHFpm0.ino
The sketch makes a LED on the Arduino plate blinking.
The state of the LED and the blinking frequency can be vontrolled by the commands
'H', 'L', '+', '-' and '0'.

* SketchAr040FlashLEDpin8OnOnOff.ino 
The LED on the plate, connected to Arduino,
 turns on for the 3 seconds. 
The voltage of 5V between GND and the Pin8 is set these 3 seconds.
Thereafter the LED turns off for the short time. 
For this short time no voltage is set to Pin8.

* SketchAr50LEDR8Y10G12HLF.ino 
The Red, Yellow and Green LEDs are on the plate, 
  connected to Arduino.
The state of the diodes ('On','Off' or 'Flash') 
  and the flashing period 
  could be controlled by the commands
  'H', 'L', 'F', '+', '-' and '0'.

* SketchAr060SoundSimple.ino
The sketch switches on periodically the piezo element connected to the arduino board

* SketchAr062SoundNotes.ino
At the sketch execution the piezo element connected to the arduino board generates the sound signals with frequencies of the notes

* SketchAr063SoundLaLaLaFa.ino
At the sketch execution, the piezo element connected to the arduino board, 
 plays notes in sequence "La La La Fa Sol Sol Sol Mi"
