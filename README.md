This repository contains the simple Arduino sketches with the description

SketchAr010EmptyEmpty
the simplest sketch that provides no operations

SketchAr020BlinkOnOff
The sketch makes a LED on the Arduino plate light up and light off periodically

SketchAr030BlinkOnOnOnOff
The LED on the Arduino plate is switched on for 3 sec.
And the voltage of 5V between the GND port and the Pin13 is set.
Thereafter the LED turns out for the short time. 
At this short time no voltage is set to Pin13.

SketchAr031BlinkControlLHFpm0
The sketch makes a LED on the Arduino plate blinking.
The state of the LED and the blinking frequency can be vontrolled by the commands
'H', 'L', '+', '-' and '0'.
