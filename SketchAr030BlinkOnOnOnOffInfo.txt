* SketchAr030BlinkOnOnOnOff.ino 
The sketch makes a LED on the Arduino board light up for 3 seconds and light off for 1 the short time periodically.
The voltage of 5V between the GND port and the Pin13 is set when the LED is lighting up.
This sketch could be used to check the ports voltage of the arduino board.
